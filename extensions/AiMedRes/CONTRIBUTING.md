  integration/             # Integration tests
  performance/             # Performance benchmarks
  regression/              # Regression tests
```

**Where to add new code:**
- New training pipelines → `src/aimedres/training/`
- Example scripts → `examples/` (choose appropriate category: basic, clinical, advanced, or enterprise)
- Unit tests → `tests/unit/` (organize by module)
- Integration tests → `tests/integration/`
- Clinical modules → `src/aimedres/clinical/`
- Compliance features → `src/aimedres/compliance/`

See [docs/REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md](docs/REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md) for the complete migration guide.

### 1. Choose an Issue
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
- For major features, discuss the approach first

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 3. Development Standards
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8, use Black for formatting
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new functionality
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings and update relevant docs
- **Commits**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages

### 4. Testing Requirements
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/                    # All unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_security/      # Security unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_training/      # Training unit tests
pytest tests/integration/             # Integration tests
pytest tests/performance/             # Performance tests
pytest tests/regression/              # Regression tests

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_training_pipeline.py
```

**Test Organization:**
- `tests/unit/` - Fast, isolated tests for individual components
  - `test_security/` - Security module tests
  - `test_training/` - Training module tests
- `tests/integration/` - Tests for component interactions and workflows
- `tests/performance/` - Performance benchmarks and optimization validation
- `tests/regression/` - Tests to prevent regression of fixed bugs

### 5. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Format code
black .

# Check style
flake8 .

# Type checking (optional but recommended)
mypy .
```
