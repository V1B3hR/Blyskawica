# Security Policy

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Last Updated**: November 2025

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**We take security seriously.** If you discover a security vulnerability in AiMedRes, please report it responsibly.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT Create Public Issues for Security Vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities should **NEVER** be reported through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### Reporting Process

#### Option 1: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/V1B3hR/AiMedRes/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with detailed information
4. Submit the report

GitHub will privately notify the maintainers, and we can discuss the issue securely.

#### Option 2: Email Reporting

If you prefer or cannot use GitHub's private reporting:

**Security Contact:** Open a GitHub issue requesting secure contact information, and a maintainer will provide a secure communication channel.

**Important:** Do not include vulnerability details in the initial public request.

### What to Include in Your Report

A good security report includes:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact if exploited
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue (if applicable)
5. **Suggested Fix**: Proposed solution (if you have one)
6. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
7. **Environment**: System details (OS, Python version, dependencies)

  - Critical vulnerabilities: 7 days
  - High severity: 14 days
  - Medium severity: 30 days
  - Low severity: 90 days

**Note**: These are targets. Complex vulnerabilities may require more time.

## Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** approach:

1. **Private Discussion**: We'll work with you privately to understand and fix the issue
2. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
3. **Release**: We'll release the fix in a security update
4. **Public Disclosure**: After the fix is released, we'll:
   - Publish a security advisory
   - Credit you (if you wish) in the advisory
   - Document the vulnerability in release notes

### Disclosure Timeline

- **90 Days**: We aim to fix and release patches within 90 days
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released, or after 90 days (whichever comes first)
- **Early Disclosure**: If the vulnerability is being actively exploited, we may disclose earlier

### Embargo Period

Please allow us reasonable time to:
- Investigate the issue
- Develop a fix
- Test the fix thoroughly
- Release the patch
- Notify affected users

**We request a 90-day embargo** before public disclosure.

## Scope

### In Scope

Security vulnerabilities in:

- ✅ Core AiMedRes codebase (`src/aimedres/`)
- ✅ API endpoints and web interfaces
- ✅ Authentication and authorization systems
- ✅ Data encryption and privacy features
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ PHI/PII handling and de-identification
- ✅ Dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- ✅ Configuration security issues

### Out of Scope

The following are generally **NOT** considered security vulnerabilities:

- ❌ Vulnerabilities in dependencies (report to the dependency maintainers)
- ❌ Issues requiring physical access to the server
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Denial of Service (DoS) attacks requiring excessive resources
- ❌ Issues in third-party integrations (unless they affect AiMedRes security)
- ❌ Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept
- ❌ Known issues already in our issue tracker

**Note**: If unsure, report it anyway. We'll help determine if it's in scope.

See [docs/SECURITY_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/SECURITY_CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed information.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Use Virtual Environments**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Never Commit Secrets**
   - Use environment variables
   - Add secrets to `.gitignore`
   - Use `.env.example` for templates

4. **Follow Secure Coding Practices**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Escape output
   - Follow principle of least privilege

### For Deployments

1. **Secure Configuration**
   - Set strong encryption keys
   - Enable HTTPS/TLS
   - Configure firewalls
   - Use secure passwords

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export AIMEDRES_MASTER_KEY="secure-random-key"
   export AIMEDRES_JWT_SECRET="secure-jwt-secret"
   ```

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit file permissions
   - Use non-root users
   - Configure network isolation
   - Enable audit logging

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Review dependency vulnerabilities

### For Medical/Research Use

1. **PHI Protection**
   - Always de-identify data
   - Use secure data processors
   - Follow HIPAA/GDPR requirements
   - Obtain appropriate approvals

2. **Research Ethics**
   - Get IRB approval
   - Obtain informed consent
   - Maintain data privacy
   - Follow institutional policies

## Known Security Considerations

### Medical AI Specific Risks

As medical AI software, AiMedRes has unique security considerations:

1. **Model Poisoning**: Malicious training data could compromise models
2. **Adversarial Examples**: Crafted inputs could fool AI models
3. **Privacy Leakage**: Models might leak training data
4. **Fairness Issues**: Biased data could lead to discriminatory outcomes

**Mitigation**: 
- Validate training data sources
- Use adversarial training techniques
- Implement differential privacy where possible
- Regular bias audits

### Research Use Only

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: AiMedRes is for **research use only** and is **NOT** approved for clinical diagnosis or treatment.

Security vulnerabilities in research software may have different implications than in production medical devices. However, we still take all security reports seriously.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current development version |
| < 0.1   | :x:                | Pre-release, not supported |

**Note**: As AiMedRes is in active development, we recommend using the latest version from the main branch.

## Security Hall of Fame

We recognize and thank security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

| Researcher | Vulnerability | Disclosed | Severity |
|------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| *None yet* | -             | -         | -        |

*Your name could be here! Report a valid security vulnerability to be recognized.*
