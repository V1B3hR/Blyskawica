- **New Metadata Fields**: Added uncertainty_score, reward_signal, synaptic_tag, conflict_flag, source_references
- **Clinical Integration**: Optimized scoring for medical decision support and patient care contexts

#### 2. Priority Replay System
- **Weighted Sampling**: Priority = novelty × uncertainty × reward (with synaptic boost)
- **Sample Size**: Configurable replay sample size (default 50 memories)
- **Replay Events**: Tracked in database with priority scores and metadata
- **Biological Plausibility**: Implements priority-based memory replay during consolidation
- **Clinical Application**: Enhanced learning from critical patient cases and treatment outcomes

#### 3. Generative Rehearsal
