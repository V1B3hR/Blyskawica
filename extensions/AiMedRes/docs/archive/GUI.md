# GUI Implementation Checklist

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Last Updated**: November 2025  
**Repository**: V1B3hR/AiMedRes

Purpose
- This file is a prioritized, actionable implementation checklist to build a clinician/researcher‑facing GUI for AiMedRes.
- It is based on a repository‑level analysis (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/, security modules, Phase2B docs, roadmap and archive docs, tests and project structure).
- Each item has: short description, acceptance criteria, rough effort estimate, and repository dependencies (files/dirs to inspect or link to).

How to use
- Create one GitHub issue per checklist item and link the relevant dependency files.
- Use acceptance criteria as gates for PR review and staging signoff.
- Track progress with Epics (see Suggested Epics section).

PRIORITY KEYS
- P0: Blocker — must be finished before any clinical pilot or user‑facing deployment
- P1: High — required for safe early production / constrained pilot
- P2: Medium — reliability, monitoring, compliance features for broader rollout
- P3: Low / Long‑term — advanced features and research integrations

Summary of repository signals used
- Contributor & process docs: CONTRIBUTING.md (clinical, security, PR templates)
- Security & privacy: docs/PHASE2B_README.md, SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md (referenced in docs/INDEX.md), security/ modules
- Regulatory & pilot state: docs/roadmap.md, docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_P8B_P9.md, RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
- APIs & code layout: src/aimedres/api, src/aimedres/clinical, src/aimedres/security, docs/API_REFERENCE.md (referenced)
- Tests: tests/unit/test_security, tests integration harness (referenced)

Notes and cautions

### Implementation Status Verification (2025-11-02)

**VERIFIED**: All mentioned features have been confirmed as implemented and tested:

- ✅ **Immutable Audit Trail**: Fully implemented in `security/blockchain_records.py` with 15/15 tests passing in `tests/test_phase2b_security.py`. Provides blockchain-based audit logging, patient consent management, smart contracts, and EHR integration.

- ✅ **PHI Scrubber**: Fully implemented in `src/aimedres/security/phi_scrubber.py` with comprehensive tests in `tests/test_phi_detection.py`. Implements HIPAA Safe Harbor method, detects 18+ PHI categories, includes clinical term whitelist, and enforces de-identification at ingestion.

- ✅ **Bias Detection Backend**: Fully implemented in `files/safety/decision_validation/bias_detector.py` with 21/21 tests passing in `tests/test_bias_detector.py`. Provides multi-dimensional bias detection, statistical significance testing, real-time monitoring, and mitigation recommendations. Integrated into MLOps canary deployment pipeline.

- ⚠️ **Bias Dashboard UI**: Backend is complete and operational (see above). A standalone frontend UI dashboard for bias visualization has not been found. The backend provides APIs for `get_bias_summary()`, `run_comprehensive_bias_audit()`, and alert callbacks that can be used to build a UI.

**See FEATURE_STATUS.md for complete verification details and test commands.**

- **License Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0) is now consistent across all files (LICENSE, README.md, setup.py, and all package metadata).
