## Quick Start

1. **First time user?** Start with `basic/run_all_demo.py`
2. **Clinical application?** Check `clinical/` for disease-specific examples
3. **Need performance?** Explore `advanced/` for parallel training
4. **Production deployment?** Review `enterprise/` for best practices

## Running Examples

Most examples can be run directly:
```bash
# Basic example
python examples/basic/run_all_demo.py

# Clinical example
python examples/clinical/alzheimer_demo.py

# Advanced parallel training
python examples/advanced/parallel_mode.py

# Enterprise production demo
python examples/enterprise/production_demo.py
```

## Dependencies

Some examples may require additional dependencies. Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt  # For ML features
```
